            <p class="info">Auden’s Col is one of the hardest trek routes in Uttarakhand. The trek commences from Gangotri. As you trek towards Nala Camp, you’ll come across pine and cane woodlands. From Nala Camp, the route will take you to the Rudra Gaira Base Camp – an ideal place to catch extraordinary glimpses of snow-laden Himalayan peaks. Connecting the peaks of Jogin I and Gangotri III and also the glaciers of Khatling and Jogin I, this trek takes you through endless glaciers, moraines, narrow cliffs, and snow ridges, thus demanding extremely high fitness.Auden's Col is arguably one of the most challenging and least explored treks in Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand. Auden's Col is a high mountain pass that connects Jogin I (6465m) and Gangotri III (6580m) peaks and is situated at a height of 5490 M.</p>
